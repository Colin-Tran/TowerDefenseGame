## Premise

Slimes are invading our class to steal Mr. David's StudyCS source code. Defend Mr. David's holy grail of an AP CSA class with towers and strategic positioning. Pay for them with the holy Wolverine Bucks bestowed upon you.

## Controls
Move mouse and click where you want to place towers. Press one or two to swap between towers. You start out with a 100 wolverine bucks and recieve more at the end of each round. Good Luck, Have Fun.

## How to Run
Since we have not learned how to compile files into .exe or .jar files, please clone this repository into an ide of your choice and run. If an ide is not avaiable, or you don't want to use one, then install jdk, preferrably the latest one, download and extract the repo, cd into the extracted folder with a command prompt of your choice, run "javac Frame.java" then run "java Frame.java".

## How we got here
This project started out as a bundle of ideas. Originally we wanted to go with a Plants vs. Zombies style game, but we found it hard to add our own spin/style to it, so we switched to a Bloons Tower Defense inspired game. We were able to switch the bloons with green slimes, and implement different towers with different abilities, similar to the aforementioned game.

## Platforms Supported

Any platform that supports the jdk tools or has an ide that supports java. You do require a mouse and keyboard to play, whether it be emulated or physical.

## FAQ

Can we add more starting money to the game?
> Sure edit the wallet instantiation of Money in Frame.java

How do we increase the resolution of the game?
> You can't. You would have to modify every other aspect of the game, from the background image, to how the slimes move (that doesn't mean you aren't free to try).

How long will development continue?
> Final release will happen between the end of May to early June.

Can I/we use fork your code to make my/our own game?
> Sure.

What is the ESRB rating on this game?
> Whatever you want it to be.

How can I support the creators?
> We don't have a common crypto wallet address, so just email Mr. David to give us an A.
